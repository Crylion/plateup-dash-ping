# plateup dash ping

Adds an overcooked-style dash to the ping button (doesn't replace ping). Seems to work in multiplayer (only affects player using the mod), but might look a little janky to other people. Not tested with couch multiplayer.

## Requirements

* BepinEx >= 5.4.21

## Installation

* Download DashPing.dll and add to your `PlateUp/BenInEx/plugins` folder.
